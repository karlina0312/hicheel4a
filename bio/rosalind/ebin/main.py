Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold
Problem: Wright-Fisher's Expected Behavior
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/ebin/

Given: A positive integer n (n≤1000000) followed by an array P of length m 
(m≤20) containing numbers between 0 and 1. Each element of P can be seen as 
representing a probability corresponding to an allele frequency.

Return: An array B of length m for which B[k] is the expected value of 
Bin(n,P[k]); in terms of Wright-Fisher, it represents the expected allele 
frequency of the next generation.
