Given: An array A of length n for which A[k] represents the proportion of 
males in a population exhibiting the k-th of n total recessive X-linked 
genes. Assume that the population is in genetic equilibrium for all n genes.

Return: An array B of length n in which B[k] equals the probability that a 
randomly selected female will be a carrier for the k-th gene.
